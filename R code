# After we import our data , we start the data analysis.

# First thing we check is if there are missing values in our dataset.

# Checking missing values
# As we can see in the Plots & Graphs file in the graph with the name "Missing Values from Dataset", we don't have any NAs.
library(DataExplorer)
plot_missing(media)


# After that we will check for multicollinearity. We don't have any among the variables, so we can proceed.
# Correlation check. 
corr<-cor(media)
corrplot::corrplot(corr)


# Multiple Linear Regression
model1 <- lm(Sales ~ ., data = media)
summary(model1)

# Stepwise variable selection
model<-stepAIC(model1,direction = "both",trace=FALSE)
summary(model)

# We conclude into the following variables:
# Sales ~ TV + Radio + Magazines + Digital

# Interpretation
# Without any spending on advertising the sales would be 2916 , which comes from organic traffic. More specific, Organic traffic is any traffic that comes to your site from a search engine, but that isn't paid for

# Hierarchicaly the focus should be on Radio , Tv and after Digital due to higher coefficient numbers

# If we spent 1000 euro in radio advertising then the sales would increase by 193 while the other variables remain constant.

# if we spent 1000 euro in TV the sales would be added 39 while the other variables remain constant.

# Anything with negative values must be paused such as magazine advertising, cause it brings loss in sales.
