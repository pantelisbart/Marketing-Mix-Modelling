# After we import our data , we start the data analysis.
# First thing we check is if there are missing values in our dataset.


# Checking missing values
# As we can see in the Plots & Graphs file in the graph with the name "Missing Values from Dataset", we don't have any NAs.
plot_missing(media)


# After that we will check for multicollinearity. We don't have any among the variables, so we can proceed.
# Correlation check. 
corr<-cor(media)
corrplot::corrplot(corr)


#Our dependent variable is normally distributed.
hist(media$Sales)


# Multiple Linear Regression
model1 <- lm(Sales ~ ., data = media)
summary(model1)


# Stepwise variable selection
model<-stepAIC(model1,direction = "both",trace=FALSE)
summary(model)


# We conclude into the following variables:
# Sales ~ TV + Radio + Magazines + Digital
# Our model has R^2= 88%. That means the model has a very good fit in our data or in other words the model captures the 88% of the variance present in our data.


# Interpretation

# Without any spending on advertising the sales would be 2916 , which comes from organic traffic. 

# In other words, Organic traffic is any traffic that comes to your site from a search engine, but that isn't paid for.

# Hierarchically the focus should be on Radio , Tv and after Digital due to higher coefficient numbers and significance.

# If we spent 1000 euro in radio advertising then the sales would increase by 193 while the other variables remain constant.

# if we spent 1000 euro in TV the sales would be added 39 while the other variables remain constant.

# Anything with negative values must be paused such as magazine advertising, cause it brings loss in sales.


#As with our simple regression, the residuals show no bias, so we can say our model fits the assumption of homoscedasticity.

#The Breusch-Pagan test is used to determine whether or not heteroscedasticity is present in a regression model. The test uses the 
#following null and alternative hypotheses: Null Hypothesis (H0): Homoscedasticity is present (the residuals are distributed with equal variance)

#Alternatively we can check whether the homoscedasticity exists or not by the following Breusch-Pagan Test.
#The p value > 0.05 so there is no heteroskedasticity. There is Homoscedasticity. Our model performs well.
